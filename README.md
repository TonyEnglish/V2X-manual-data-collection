# Work Zone Data Collection Tool

The WZDC tool is an open source work zone capturing tool. Using a gps and a computer, a user can drive through a work zone and mark important elements of the work zone, including lane closures, speed limits, and the presence of workers. This data is captured and output as RSM messages in xml and binary (uper) formats and a WZDx message.
